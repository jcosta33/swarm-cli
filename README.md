# Swarm CLI

A self-improving, agentic CLI toolkit for orchestrating AI agents in isolated git worktrees.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Install globally (or use `npx`):

```bash
npm link        # from the repo root
# or
npm install -g swarm-cli
```

Run the dashboard:

```bash
swarm
```

This opens an interactive TUI where you can create sandboxes, open agents, list worktrees, and run validations. Commands are also available directly for scripting and power users:

```bash
swarm new my-feature "Implement the new billing module"
swarm list
swarm open my-feature
swarm validate
```

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Sandboxing (Worktrees):** Agents never work directly in your main repository directory. The CLI provisions dedicated `git worktree` environments. This prevents agents from accidentally breaking your active workspace or conflicting with uncommitted changes.
- **Task-Driven:** Every agent session is driven by a Markdown task file (e.g., `.agents/tasks/<slug>.md`). This file contains the objective, constraints, and a strict verification checklist that the agent must complete before declaring the task done.
- **Empirical Verification:** Agents are required to prove their work. They must paste actual console output from tests, linters, and compilers into their task files to verify correctness.
- **State Management:** The CLI tracks all active sandboxes, their PIDs, and their current status in `.agents/state.json`.

## 🛠️ Command Reference

The Swarm CLI is organized into evolutionary waves of capabilities, from basic workspace management to enterprise-scale production engineering.

### Core Subcommands

Manage the lifecycle of agent sandboxes.

- `new [slug] [title]` - Create a new sandbox worktree and task file.
- `open <slug>` - Reopen an existing sandbox terminal.
- `list` - List all active sandboxes and their status.
- `show <slug>` - Show detailed metadata and history for a specific sandbox.
- `task <slug>` - Interactive prompt to append human feedback/hints to the task file.
- `validate` - Run configured linters and typechecks, truncating output for LLM context limits.
- `test` - Run the test runner (Vitest) with smart log truncation.
- `test-radius <file>` - Calculate the blast radius of a file and run only the impacted specs.
- `pr <slug>` - Auto-commit changes and generate a GitHub Pull Request based on the completed task file.
- `screenshot [url]` - Capture a screenshot of the running app using Playwright for visual validation by an LLM.
- `health` - Run pre-flight environment checks.

### Context & Analysis

Tools for deep codebase understanding, context compression, and security analysis.

- `compress <file>` - Strip function bodies from a TypeScript file to save LLM context tokens while retaining signatures.
- `graph <file>` - Extract and map the import/export dependencies of a module.
- `references <symbol>` - Fast codebase scan to find usages of a specific symbol or class.
- `docs <file>` - Extract and format JSDoc blocks from a module.
- `complexity <file>` - Calculate cyclomatic complexity heuristics to enforce maintainability invariants.
- `audit-sec <file>` - Scan for common dangerous patterns, secrets, and vulnerabilities.
- `dead-code <file>` - Find exported symbols that are never imported anywhere in the project.
- `format <file>` - Wrapper for Prettier/ESLint autofixes with truncated output.
- `logs <slug>` - View the execution output logs of a running agent session.
- `health` - Run pre-flight environment checks for the Swarm.
- `context [dir]` - Generate a semantic map of exported symbols for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- `memory <get|set|list>` - Global memory bank for cross-agent invariant tracking and learned preferences.

### Autonomous Lifecycles

Tools for independent agent collaboration, planning, and self-healing.

- `epic <file>` - Decompose a high-level markdown list into individual, actionable child tasks.
- `triage <file>` - Convert an unstructured bug report into a strict, verifiable technical spec.
- `arch` - Lint and enforce cross-module boundary invariants and architectural rules.
- `review <slug>` - Spawn an adversarial peer-review agent session to critique another agent's work.
- `chat <slug> [msg]` - Send or read an IPC message with another running agent.
- `repro` - Verify that test files were modified _before_ source code to enforce Test-Driven Development.
- `find <type> <target>` - Semantic search across the codebase (e.g., find all classes that implement an interface).
- `mock <file> <Name>` - Instantly generate a TypeScript mock factory for a specific interface.
- `daemon` - Background watcher that automatically runs `test-radius` when human developers save files.
- `heal` - Self-healing hotfix generator that triggers automatically on CI branch failures.

### Production Scale

Enterprise-scale orchestration tools for massive refactors and reliability engineering.

- `refactor <dir> <goal>` - Break a massive refactor into 5-file chunks and distribute them as tasks.
- `deps` - Find outdated packages, fetch release notes, and generate upgrade tasks.
- `migrate <file> <lang>` - Spawn a Translator and Verifier agent pair to rewrite code into a new language/framework.
- `fuzz <file> <func>` - Generate and execute unexpected test permutations (nulls, NaNs, etc.) against a function signature.
- `chaos <start|stop>` - Inject latency and mock network failures into the local environment to test resilience.
- `visual <baseline|compare>` - Screenshot-based visual regression comparison loop.
- `knowledge <query>` - Semantic vector-like search across past tasks, PRs, and specs.
- `telemetry` - Dashboard tracking Swarm resource/token usage, time-to-completion, and success rates.
- `profile <cmd>` - Analyze a Node process for bottlenecks and assign a Performance Engineer agent to optimize them.
- `release` - Auto-bump semantic version, generate a changelog from git history, and draft release notes.

### Workspace Management

Utilities for maintaining a clean Swarm environment.

- `ast rename` - Structural rename utility for safely modifying symbols across the project.
- `lock <claim|release|list>` - Advisory file locking for parallel agent coordination.
- `merge <branch>` - Merge a branch with structured conflict reporting.
- `remove <slug>` - Forcefully remove a sandbox and delete its worktree.
- `prune` - Clean up and remove merged or orphaned sandboxes.
- `doctor` - Run diagnostic preflight checks on the CLI and workspace.
- `path <slug>` - Print the absolute filesystem path to a specific sandbox worktree.
- `focus <slug>` - Open the specified sandbox worktree in your default editor.
- `pick` - Interactive fuzzy-finder menu to select tasks for `new`, `open`, `focus`, or `remove`.

## 🔒 Safety & Permissions

The Swarm CLI operates under a strict "Show, Don't Tell" philosophy. Agents are required to provide empirical proof (console output) of their success. The CLI defaults to non-destructive actions, but agents have full filesystem access within their isolated worktrees.

When an agent completes a task, human review is typically performed by reading the self-review section of the task file and running `swarm pr <slug>` to merge the verified code back into the main repository.
