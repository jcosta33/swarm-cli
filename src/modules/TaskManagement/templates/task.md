## Objective

What this session must accomplish. One paragraph maximum.
Be specific. Vague objectives produce vague outcomes.

---

## Linked docs

- Spec: `{{specFile}}`

---

## Constraints

- Work only inside this worktree
- Do not switch branches unless explicitly instructed
- Do not merge, rebase, or push unless explicitly instructed
- Run `{{cmdInstall}}` to install modules
- Run `pnpm deps:validate` after every change
- **Proactively research and read related docs.** If context from another spec, research, or bug file is needed, you are empowered to browse `.agents/specs/`, `.agents/research/`, or `.agents/bugs/` on your own to confirm your hypotheses and make informed decisions. Any other codebase docs (`docs/`, `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills/`, `.agents/audits/`) are also fair game.

## Decisions

Key decisions made during this session and why.

- ***

## Findings

Codebase discoveries worth preserving. Move anything durable to an audit or spec.

- ***

## Assumptions

Things assumed to be true that were not explicitly confirmed.
Mark each as `[pending]` or `[confirmed]` as the session progresses.

- [pending]

---

## Blockers

Anything preventing progress. What is needed to unblock.

- ***

## Next steps

Concrete starting points for the next session if this one ends incomplete.

- ***

## Self-review

<self_review>

Stop. Act as a nitpicky senior engineer reviewing your own work as if you didn't write it. You are looking for a reason to reject it. Read every change adversarially.

> **Hard gate.** The task is not complete until every question below has a written answer directly beneath it. An unanswered question is a skipped check. Incomplete Self-review is an invalid session output. If you cannot point to a specific file/line/requirement for a finding, do not pad the list.

### Verification outputs (paste actual command output — do not paraphrase)

- `git status` →
- `pnpm deps:validate` (last 2 lines):
- `pnpm typecheck` (last 2 lines):
- `pnpm test:run` (last 2 lines):

### Correctness

- Does the implementation do exactly what was asked? Not approximately — exactly.
  Answer:

### Architecture

- Zero validation errors? (see pasted output above) Does `{{cmdTypecheck}}` pass?
  Answer:

### Conventions

- No `useMemo`/`useCallback`/`React.memo`. No `&&` in JSX rendering. No `interface` — use `type`. No `enum` — use `as const`. No barrel files except each module’s root `index.ts` (curated re-exports only). No cross-module internal imports.
  Answer:

### Primary deliverable and related work

- The **Objective** is what you must ship. If you fixed or improved something outside that path, note it in **Findings** or **Decisions** (what and why). Do not revert correct work only because it was not named in the Objective.
  Answer:

### Completeness

- Is anything left stubbed, TODO'd, or half-finished? Would the next developer be able to continue from this task file and Self-review alone with zero questions?
  Answer:

### Final Polish

- Did you ask yourself: "What else could I do? How can I make this even better, more stable, or more bug-free?" Do not second-guess every decision, but do not leave the work without this final adversarial pass.
  Answer:

Only when every answer above is written is this task complete.
